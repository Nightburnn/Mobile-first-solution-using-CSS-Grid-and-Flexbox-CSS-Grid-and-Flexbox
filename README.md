# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

I tackled the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) as part of my ongoing efforts to enhance my coding skills. Engaging with Frontend Mentor challenges provides valuable opportunities to build practical projects and refine my proficiency in web development.

### What I learned

# Learnings from HTML and CSS Code

- **HTML Structure**: Utilized the standard HTML5 structure, including essential meta tags and favicon, to create a well-formed document.

- **Viewport Configuration**: Implemented the viewport meta tag to ensure proper rendering on various devices.

- **CSS Font Import**: Imported external fonts (in this case, "Outfit" from Google Fonts) and applied them to the entire document.

- **Global Reset**: Applied a global reset to remove default margin and padding from all elements for a consistent starting point in styling.

- **Mobile-First Design**: Employed a mobile-first approach by setting a minimum width for the container and centering it horizontally, making the design responsive.

- **Flexbox Usage**: Used Flexbox (`display: flex` and `align-items: center`) to vertically center the content within the body.

- **Card Styling**: Styled a card component with a specific background color, padding, border-radius, and text alignment.

- **Image Styling**: Applied styling to an image (QR code in this case) with a width of 100% and a border-radius for a visually pleasing appearance.

- **Text Styling**: Defined styles for text elements within the card, including heading and paragraph.
